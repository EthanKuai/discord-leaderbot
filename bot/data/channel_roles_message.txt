Use `.role <roles separated by ,>` to assign roles to yourself.
**NOTE THIS DOES NOT ONLY ADD ROLES BUT CHANGES THE STATUS OF THE ROLE**
> ie. already have role -> no longer have role & vice versa

**Available roles**
*CLASS ROLES*     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
*GROUP ROLES*     A, B, C, D, E

**Examples**
If you are in-charge of 401, use `.role 1`
If you are in-charge of 401 & 1B for quests, use `.role 1,B`
If you accidentally gave yourself the wrong role, you can always undo it with the same command
